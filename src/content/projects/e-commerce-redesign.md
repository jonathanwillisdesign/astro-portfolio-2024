# E-commerce Redesign

## Overview

This project involved a complete redesign of an established e-commerce platform. The goal was to improve user experience, increase conversion rates, and modernize the visual design.

## Challenge

The existing platform had an outdated interface and a complicated checkout process, leading to high cart abandonment rates. Our challenge was to simplify the user journey while maintaining all necessary functionality.

## Process

1. **User Research**: Conducted user interviews and analyzed site analytics to identify pain points.
2. **Wireframing**: Created low-fidelity wireframes to establish new information architecture.
3. **Prototyping**: Developed interactive prototypes for user testing.
4. **Visual Design**: Applied a fresh, modern visual design language consistent with the brand.
5. **Usability Testing**: Conducted multiple rounds of usability tests to refine the design.

## Outcome

The redesigned platform saw a 35% decrease in cart abandonment and a 20% increase in overall conversion rate within the first month of launch. User feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with particular praise for the streamlined checkout process.
